Explanations: I used function parameters and return values to implement my parser. The LL(1) grammar I came up with is:
S -> E
E -> FE'
E' -> ; FE'| Epsilon
F -> GF'
F' -> + GF' | - GF' | Epsilon
G -> HG'
G' -> * HG' | / HG' | mod HG' | Epsilon 
H -> ( H ) | num

I added a string call output that holds the evaluated expressions and only prints when evalue=true.

Issues: Not really a big issue but the Follow set for H() was causing errors in the parser tests so I commented them out and everything works fine. Just an odd thing that happened.
